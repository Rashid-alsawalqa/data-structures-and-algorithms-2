# Reverse an Array
First code challenge of Career Track

## Challenge
Write a function that is passed an array as an argument and returns an array with all the elements reversed... without using any built in methodology.

## Approach & Efficiency 
My thought was to get the length of the array, and create a for loop that would take each element of the array from reverse and push it into a new array. I'm not sure if push was an outlawed methodology.
