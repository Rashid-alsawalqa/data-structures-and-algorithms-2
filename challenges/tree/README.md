# Challenge Summary
Class 15: tree

## Challenge Description
Create Node class that has left and right child nodes
create a BinaryTree class
  methods: preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder
create a BinarySearchTree class 
  methods: 
  add, adds a new node with value in correct location, 
  contains, accepts value and returns boolean if value is in tree at least once

Extend binary tree class to include a breadth first traversal

Extend binary tree class to include a find-maximum-value


## Approach & Efficiency
preOrder: parent than children
inOrder: left children then parent, than right children
postOrder: parent after children

In order to check if those methods work, i need an add function, so I am just combining both classes into one!

Visit each node of a tree at each level before going to the next level

Visit each node of the tree and save a maximum, compare values of each and reassign if necessary.
